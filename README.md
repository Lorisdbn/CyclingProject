# Cycling traffic in Paris
The City of Paris has been deploying permanent bicycle counters for several years to assess the development of cycling.<br>
The aim of this project is to carry out an analysis of the data collected by these bike counters in order to visualize the timetables and the areas of affluence.<br>
This will aim to provide tools to the town hall of Paris so that it can judge the improvements to be made to the various cycling areas of the city.<br>
The project has been led from May to July, 2024.<br>
