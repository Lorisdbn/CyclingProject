# Cycling traffic in Paris
The City of Paris has been deploying permanent bicycle counters for several years to assess the development of cycling.
The aim of this project is to carry out an analysis of the data collected by these bike counters in order to visualize the timetables and the areas of affluence.
This will aim to provide tools to the town hall of Paris so that it can judge the improvements to be made to the various cycling areas of the city.
The project has been led from May to July, 2024.
